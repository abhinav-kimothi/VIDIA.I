## Roadmap Ahead

While VIDIA remains a modest side project, I harbor grand ambitions for its future development. 

- I am actively working towards expanding its capabilities to handle video and audio transcripts, spreadsheets, and even complete websites. 

- I aim to enhance VIDIA with advanced features, such as analyzing spreadsheets with charts, handling multiple inputs, and addressing larger documents using embeddings. 

- I am committed to utilizing models and embeddings that are freely accessible to all developers, ensuring inclusivity.
